# Histopathology Markup Language

Computational pathology provides accurate tools for defining the intra-tumoral ecological spatial context, having substantial implications for cancer research and medicine. However, the large-scale implementation of computational pathology has been hindered by the lack of a common information standard to represent various histopathological features. Here we propose **Histopathology Markup Language (HistoML) Level 1** and **Histopathology Ontology** for comprehensively and precisely representing various histopathological features, including histopathological phenotypes, their individual components as well as diagnosing logics of pathologists at multiple levels of detail, in a machine-understandable format. We pilot HistoML in representing histopathological features of several neoplastic diseases and exemplify computational analyses on the representations. **The example representation files, the source code of the uses cases, Histopathology Ontology, as well as the ontology specification and documentation of HistoML are available in this repository.**



## Short guideline for how to use Protégé

**It is recommended to view .owl and .xml files in this repository via Protégé.**

Protégé is a free, open-source ontology editor.

You could download and install Protégé Desktop from the [Protégé website](http://protege.stanford.edu/products.php#desktop-protege).

Please follow the [step-by-step instructions to install Protégé](http://protegeproject.github.io/protege/installation).

There are some [useful resources](http://owl.cs.manchester.ac.uk/publications/talks-and-tutorials/protg-owl-tutorial/) for you to learn how to use Protégé.

We upload the PDF version of [Protégé tutorial](https://github.com/Peiliang/HistoML/blob/master/ProtegeOWLTutorialP4_v1_3.pdf) in this repository in case you find it difficult to download it elsewhere. This tutorial is a good beginner's guideline to Protégé.
