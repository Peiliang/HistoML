# Histopathology Markup Language

Computational pathology provides accurate tools for defining the intra-tumoral ecological spatial context, having substantial implications for cancer research and medicine. However, the large-scale implementation of computational pathology has been hindered by the lack of a common information standard to represent various histopathological features. Here we propose **Histopathology Markup Language (HistoML) Level 1** and **Histopathology Ontology** for comprehensively and precisely representing various histopathological features, including histopathological phenotypes, their individual components as well as diagnosing logics of pathologists at multiple levels of detail, in a machine-understandable format. We pilot HistoML in representing histopathological features of several neoplastic diseases and exemplify computational analyses on the representations. **The representation files, the source code of the uses cases, Histopathology Ontology, as well as the ontology specification and documentation of HistoML are available in this repository.**



## Short guideline for how to use Protégé

**It is recommended to view the ontology specification of HistoML (i.e. HistoML.owl ), all the example HistoML representations and Histopathology Ontology via Protégé.**

Protégé is a free, open-source ontology editor.
