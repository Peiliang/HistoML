# Histopathology Markup Language

Computational pathology provides "big-data" approach to pathology, having substantial implications for cancer research and medicine. However, the large-scale implementation of computational pathology has been hindered by the lack of a standardized format representing various histopathological features (e.g. in whole-slide-images). Here we propose **Histopathology Markup Language (HistoML)** and **Histopathology Ontology** for precisely representing various histopathological features in tumor, including histopathological phenotypes observed in whole-slide-images or individualized diagnosing logics and results collected from pathology reports at different granularity and in a machine-understandable format. We pilot HistoML in representing histopathological features contained in histopathology data of several neoplastic diseases and exemplify different uses of the representations. **The example representation files, the source code of the uses cases, Histopathology Ontology, as well as the ontology specification and documentation of HistoML Level1 are available in this repository.**
