We provide four example representations here:

Alveolar_Pattern.xml;

Rhabdoid_Feature.xml;

Tumor_Extends_into_Renal_Sinus.xml;

Subtyping_Process.xml;



## A guide to view these representations

It is recommend to view these files via Protégé. Click on the **File** menu, choose **Open**, find and select the example representations you want to view in Protégé. 

Normally, Protégé would successfully open these files. However, since opening the files involves importing an external ontology (i.e. HistoML.owl) by the owl:imports property, Protégé may fail to find the imported ontology on some occasions (e.g. Internet issues). In this case Protégé will generate a dialog illustrating this error looking like this:

To correctly open the example representations, please click **是(N)** and manually point Protégé to a location where the HistoML.owl can be found in your computer.
