# Rhabdoid cells in RCC

For ease reference, the rhabdoid cells represented in the Rhabdoid_Feature.xml are numbered in the figure shown below. The values of 'rdf:ID' of these cells in Rhabdoid_Feature.xml are correspondingly “Rhabdoid_Cell1”, “Rhabdoid_Cell2” and “Rhabdoid_Cell3” etc. Readers could easily find their corresponding individuals of 'NeoplasticCell' to access the represented features (e.g. quantitative information of their properties).
