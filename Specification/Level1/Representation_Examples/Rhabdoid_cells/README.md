# Rhabdoid cells in RCC

For ease reference, the rhabdoid cells represented in the Rhabdoid_Feature.xml are numbered in the figure below. The values of 'rdf:ID' of these cells in Rhabdoid_Feature.xml are correspondingly “Rhabdoid_Cell1”, “Rhabdoid_Cell2” and “Rhabdoid_Cell3” etc. Using 'rdf:ID', readers could easily index these cells as well as their features (e.g. quantitative information of their attributes) in Rhabdoid_Feature.xml.
