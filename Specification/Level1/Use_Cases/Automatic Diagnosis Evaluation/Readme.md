## Automatic Diagnosis Evaluation

This use case demonstrates how to automatically evaluate whether a diagnosis represented in a HistoML representation comforms to the corresponding diagnostic criterion.

#### Important Files

HistoML.owl: Ontology specification of HistoML.

Histopathology Ontology Simplified.owl: The logic of the diagnostic criterion is represented in Histopathology Ontology.

Evaluation.java: Source code of automatic diagnosis evaluation.

Automatic Evaluation Intestinal Adenocarcinoma Correct.xml & Automatic Evaluation Intestinal Adenocarcinoma Wrong.xml: Two example HistoML representations containing a correct diagnosis and a wrong diagnosis respectively.

#### How to Use

Run the use case:

```shell
java -jar Evaluation.jar "Automatic Evaluation Intestinal Adenocarcinoma Wrong.xml"
```

Java 11 runtime is required.

#### Output Format

Below is the example output for "Automatic Evaluation Intestinal Adenocarcinoma Wrong.xml":

The output indicates that there are 3 diagnoses for this case, i.e. Diagnosis1~3.

Diagnosis1 states that this case is Cervical Adenocarcinoma, which is evaluated as true, through the guideline provided by Female Genital Tumours: WHO Classification of Tumours (Medicine) 5th Edition. There are two evidences that supports this claim: Glandular_Pattern5 and Glandular_Pattern4.

Similar to Diagnosis1, Diagnosis2 states that this case is Human Papillomavirus-Related Endocervical Adenocarcinoma, which is evaluated as true.

Diagnosis3 states that this case is Adenocarcinoma, HPV-associated, intestinal type, which is evaluated as false, because given evidences are not enough to yield this result. Instead, this case is shown to be Adenocarcinoma, HPV-associated, mucinous type, with supporting evidences Glandular_Pattern5, Glandular_Pattern4 and Quantitative_Metric2.
