## Automatic Representation Generation

This use case demonstrates how to automatically generate HistoML representations.

#### Important Files

Template.xml: Template to generate HistoML representation files.

Generate.java: Source code of generating HistoML representations.

Execute.py: Execute the use case.

Representation.xml: HistoML representation generated by this use case.

#### How to Use

Install all requirements for python:

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Download model files from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11S064aegdil-CI-SdYk0DHp2n7d2Nv-8/view?usp=sharing) and extract all files into micronet folder.

Run the use case:

```shell
python3 Execute.py Example.png
```

CUDA environment and Java 11 runtime is required to run the queries.

After executing the script, Representation.xml will be generated as the HistoML representation of Example.png.
